# pyqt5-calculator
A normal scientific calculator coded with Python and QtDesigner. Personal project for Python and PyQt5 practice, and mostly just fun.. 

I will be documenting my progress with it as I go, as it is my very first github/python project...


##Version 1.0: Basic input and output
              Two operation types: Division and Multiplication.


Needs Python 3.x and PyQt5.
